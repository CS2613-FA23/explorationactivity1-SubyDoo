# ExplorationActivity1


## 1. What package/library does this program demonstrate?
The package used in [sentenceReportGUI.py](https://github.com/CS2613-FA23/explorationactivity1-SubyDoo/blob/main/sentenceReportGUI.py) and [helloWorldGUI.py](https://github.com/CS2613-FA23/explorationactivity1-SubyDoo/blob/main/helloWorldGUI.py) is Tkinter. <br />

It is the only GUI functionality that comes in python's standard library, it is lightweight and so it is beginner friendly, however, it does have an outdated look/functionality where other popular 3rd party GUI libraries don't suffer from.
