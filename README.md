> python3 sentenceReportGUI.py <br />
> python3 helloWorld.py
 <br />




## 3. What purpose dose the programs serve

- The helloWorldGUI program is there just to show how quick and easy it is to create your first program using Tkinter

- The sentenceReportGUI program is the Python PQ1 converted to use GUI instead of a textual interface. It shows a different way to interact with a user as opposed to the textual user interface. <br />
   <br />
  The program will take a string as input thought the GUI and report some statistics such as the total number of alphabetic characters, total number words with repeated alphabetic characters, and total number of end-start letter matches between words.
   <br />
   <br />
  It demonstrates the use of grids and grid alignment, frames, entry widget for function input, buttons that trigger functions, labels, color, and padding.
