## 2. What is the package/library and functionality?

- What purpose does it serve

  Tkinter (TK interface) is the only graphical user interface (GUI) functionality that comes in python's standard library. It is a wrapper for an extension called TK of another programming language called TCL and implements its widgets as classes in python [1].
  Tkinter uses a window as the foundation and widgets to provide functionalily while adding its own logic over the TCL functionality [3]. It is lightweight and so it is beginner friendly, however, it does have an outdated look/functionality where some other popular 3rd party python GUI libraries don't suffer from [2].

## 3. When was it created?
Tkinter has been part of Python's standard library since version 1.1 released in 1994 [1][2].

## 4. Why did you select this package/library
I selected this library because I am currently learning to create UI in Java with JavaFX. When I was first learning java, the process of creating a GUI with javaFX was more of a challenge to understand.
Since taking this class, I had the chance to learn python more and now prefer it over java because of the simplicity to do something. I wanted to see if this is the case as well with UI creation. I also would like to
create more complex GUI based programs in Python related to data extraction and representation in the future.

 <br />







## 5. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?
Using Tkinter helped me further understand interactive programs in python and the similarity it has with that I already knew in JavaFX. The was the first time I read through the documentation of a library to a greater extent so I 
learned how some python libraries are structured. This may help me when looking at future python libraries.

## 6. How was your overall experience with the package/library?
- When would you recommend this package/library to someone?
I would recommend this package to someone who prefers python over java and who has no experience with graphical user interfaces and would like an intoduction. The simplicity of this library makes it easy to understand
however, it may take some trial and error to get the grid placement for widgets in the right spot. I did not like the error details you would get when you did something wrong as it didn't help me identify the issue without research.

- Would you continue using this package/library? Why or why not?
I would continue using this package but not for much longer as I would like to move to more modern/complex GUI libraries to create better looking programs. Since I am already learning the fundamentals in JavaFX I think it would be better to
move on to something more advanced in a language I prefer more.
